# Slime-origin-edit
This is an edit of Jack_Sibley's Slimecican origin, preventing crash on server and adding a super jump. All credit goes to Jack Sibley for the mod, MrLightningBlaze for the server crashing fix, and 𝒜𝒜𝒜𝒜𝒜𝒜 for the jump boost. All I did was add them together and fix some minor things (such as blue skin instead of green).  𝒜𝒜𝒜𝒜𝒜𝒜's datapack can be found on the origins discord, MrLightningBlaze's fix can be found  here:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tFouUCXfMmx-1y_d7gvOaZitbi_Yb5sj/view?usp=sharing (will probably be deleted once OG mod is updated), and the original mod can be found here: https://github.com/Jack-Sibley/slimeorigin. Enjoy!
